          <p>Successfully containerized a clientâ€™s PHP-based web application using Docker, enabling consistent environments across development, staging, and production. Designed and implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, automating build, test, and deployment processes to reduce manual intervention and accelerate release cycles by 60%. Infrastructure was provisioned on AWS using Terraform, ensuring infrastructure-as-code (IaC) best practices, environment consistency, and seamless scalability.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">ðŸ”¹ Challenge & Resolution â€“ Docker Networking & Service Integration</h3>
          <p>Initially encountered connectivity issues between the PHP application and MySQL database running in separate Docker containersâ€”resulting in failed deployments and downtime during testing. Diagnosed root causes including isolated container networks, incorrect environment variable handling, and misconfigured service dependencies. Solution: Implemented Docker Compose to define a custom bridge network, manage service orchestration, and inject environment-specific configurations securely. Standardized container communication through defined aliases and health checks, while externalizing database credentials using environment variables. This resolved connectivity instability and ensured reliable, repeatable deployments.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">ðŸ”¹ Dockerized Application Deployment with Nginx Reverse Proxy & Custom Domain</h3>
          <p>Containerized a clientâ€™s production-grade web application using Docker, ensuring environment consistency and portability. Integrated Nginx as a reverse proxy within the Docker ecosystem to efficiently route external traffic to the containerized application, improving performance and security. Successfully mapped the application to a custom domain (e.g., app.client.com) and enabled secure, public access over HTTPS, providing a professional and scalable web presence.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">ðŸ”¹ Challenge & Resolution â€“ Nginx Proxy & Domain Routing Issues</h3>
          <p>Initially, the application failed to load on the domain despite successful container startup. Investigation revealed misconfigured Nginx server blocks, incorrect port mappings between container and host, and unresolved DNS propagation delays. The proxy returned 502 Bad Gateway errors due to Nginx being unable to reach the upstream container service. Solution: Refactored the Nginx configuration with correct proxy_pass directives and upstream server definitions. Ensured proper host port exposure (-p 80:80) and verified container network connectivity. Set up accurate A records and DNS configurations with the domain registrar, aligning with the serverâ€™s public IP. Validated end-to-end flow using curl, browser testing, and Nginx error logs for rapid debugging.</p>
